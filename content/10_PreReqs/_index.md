# Pre-requisites

Requirements for the labs:

* Internet access to include access to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and to include the ability to access and use the [GitHub File Editor](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository).

* An account on [https://github.com](https://github.com) and a basic understanding of how to use GitHub to edit files in the web UI, and create and work with pull requests. If you are new to GitHub or just new to using GitHub pull requests then you should review [this GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) before the workshop.

* Finally, we highly recommend using the Google Chrome browser to work through the lab content.
