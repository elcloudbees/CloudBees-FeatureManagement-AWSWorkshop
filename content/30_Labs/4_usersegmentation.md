## Changing Flag Behavior for a Defined Audience
The goal of this lab is route a _subset_ of the microblog's audience to experience one value of a feature flag, while the rest of the users will see a separate value. The intended sub-group will be created in the CloudBees Feature Management interface and defined by properties in code, and then communicated to the CloudBees Feature Management dashboard through the setup function in the flags.js file. This lab will implement logic to _display the sidebar_ **only for logged in, Beta Users**.

### Add Properties from Code to CloudBees Feature Management Dashboard

1. First we need to make sure the isLoggedIn and betaAccess functions are available to be used in the flags.js file. Make sure you are on the development branch of the microblog-frontend repository, navigate to the flags.js file (src/utils/flags.js). Click the pencil icon to edit the file. ![Edit flags.js on development branch](edit-flags-deve-branch.png?width=50pc)
2. Allow flags.js to call isLoggedIn and betaAccess functions. Import store and betaAccess from their respective definition files. Starting on **Line 2**, include the following import calls:
```javascript
import store from '../store'
import { betaAccess } from './users'
```

3. The isLoggedIn and betaAccess boolean functions have to be communicated to the CloudBees Feature Management dashboard. To accomplish this, set up a setCustomBooleanProperty call for each of the functions. Before the Rox.register line, add the following lines:
```javascript
Rox.setCustomBooleanProperty('isLoggedIn', store.getters.isLoggedIn)
Rox.setCustomBooleanProperty('hasBetaAccess', betaAccess())
```

4. Review your edits with updated code below

```javascript
import Rox from 'rox-browser'
import store from '../store'
import { betaAccess } from './users'

export const Flags = 
{
      sidebar: new Rox.Flag(false),
      title: new Rox.Flag(false)
}

export const configurationFetchedHandler = fetcherResults => {
      console.log('The configuration status is: ' + fetcherResults.fetcherStatus)
      if (fetcherResults.hasChanges && fetcherResults.fetcherStatus === 'APPLIED_FROM_NETWORK') {
        window.location.reload(false)
      } else if (fetcherResults.fetcherStatus === 'ERROR_FETCH_FAILED') {
        console.log('Error occured! Details are: ' + fetcherResults.errorDetails)
      }
}

async function initCloudBees () {
      const options = {
        configurationFetchedHandler: configurationFetchedHandler
      }
      Rox.setCustomBooleanProperty('isLoggedIn', store.getters.isLoggedIn)
      Rox.setCustomBooleanProperty('hasBetaAccess', betaAccess())
      Rox.register('default', Flags)
      await Rox.setup(process.env.VUE_APP_CLOUDBEES_KEY, options)
}

initCloudBees().then(function () {
      console.log('Done loading CloudBees Feature Management')
})

``` 
</details>
5. Create a commit message (e.g. "Added setCustomBooleanProperty"). **Commit changes** directly to the development branch. Open the new deployment URL, so that the properties can be created to the dashboard.

### Create a Target Group Based on Custom Properties

1. In the CloudBees Feature Management dashboard, navigate to the **Target Groups** displayed on the left. Select the **Create a New Group** button in the middle of the resulting page.
2. We are going to create a new Target Group, _useful when defined by 2 or more customProperties_. Enter ***BetaUsers*** as the **Name** of the new group, a subset that will be defined by the isLoggedIn and betaAccess properties.
3. A microblog user is considered part of the **BetaUsers** group when **both** of the following conditions are met:
   * isLoggedIn is **True**
   * hasBetaAccess is **True**
   * Reflect this logic in the **BetaUsers** Target Group Window be defining the first **Condition** as isLoggedIn **Is True**. Then, **Add a New Condition**, select the ***Matches All Conditions*** option, and the select the betaAccess **Property** as **Is True**.

4. Once your **BetaUsers** New Target Group definition looks similar to screenshot below click **Create Group** button so it can be used in experiments. ![New target group](new-target-group.png?width=50pc)


### Using a Target Group in a Configuration

1. Within the CloudBees Feature Management dashboard, navigate to the **Development** environment, and click on the **sidebar** configuration.
2. Create a new condition by selecting **Add New Condition**. Within the new condition, change the audience selection from **All Users** to **Target Group**. Edit the remainder of the if condition block so that _for a Target Group that matches any of BetaUsers, the sidebar flag value is ***True***.
3. Edit the older condition that became the else block such that the sidebar flag value will be **False**. The configuration modifications should match the following screenshot. ![Update sidebar experiment](update-sidebar-experiment.png?width=50pc)
4. Apply the configuration changes by clicking **Save Targeting**.
5. Navigate to the microblog website to test the configuration logic.
   * Log in with the username admin and the password admin and then navigate back to the homepage. The sidebar should be hidden!
   * Log out, and sign in with the username betauser and betauser password. Upon, navigating back to the homepage the sidebar is now displayed (you may need to refresh the browser page), as we configured it to be _only for Beta Users_.
